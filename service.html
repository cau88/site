		  	I am a big believer in the power of education, and the mission to make education accessible to all audiences.
			I also care deeply about helping young members of society develop, and know that they can positively contribute
			to the world that they are in. As a result, the majority of my community service is in the realm of education,
			advocacy, youth development, and supporting historically underrepresented groups.

				I work on college preparation for high schoolers in under-resourced urban areas.
				This consists of many things, most of which is individual mentorship and workshop hosting.
				<br>
				In regards to individual mentorship, there are some students who I have met that have requested 
				having an overall mentor. I usually help keep track of how these students are doing in their
				classes, recommend scholarships and programs to apply to, as well as help with the college
				application process. The drive behind this type of work is so that students can see themselves
				attending and succeeding in college, even if they are the first around themselves to do so or 
				do not currently know how to access resources available to them.
<!-- 				<br>
				In regards to workshop hosting, I sometimes run college informational sessions, 
				and I often do a lot of work in regards to access to computer science education. -->

				I believe there is a lot of power in Computer Science (CS). With CS, individuals can solve problems, 
				create accessible resources, build their own recreational products, and change their world. 
				For this reason, I advocate for making Computer Science accessible to a larger and more diverse audience. 
				Additionally, I support organizations with similar missions and goals. 
				<br>
				I have been a volunteer for the Connecticut Computer Science Teachers Association (CTCSTA) since 2009, 
				and I most recently worked for the Congressional App Challenge in Washington D.C.

				<br><i>&nbsp; Mar. 2017-Jun. 2017</i> <a href="http://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/">The Congressional 
				App Challenge </a> is an initiative created to encourage students across America to code. District-wide competitions, 
				where students submit original projects/products/applications,
				are held by Members of Congress.
				<br>&nbsp; This program was unique because it fell well at the intersection of my interests in
				Government, Computer Science, and Education. I enjoyed the work that I did, but I even more so enjoyed 
				seeing the excitement that the winning student's had when presenting their projects and meeting their
				Members of Congress.
